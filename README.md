# Sales-prediction-using-supervised-machine-learning

Machine learning project for predicting weekly sales of walmart.

This problem consists of historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions. Each store contains a number of departments, and the task is predicting the department-wide sales for each store.
In addition, Walmart runs several promotional markdown events throughout the year. These markdowns precede prominent holidays, the four largest of which are the Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. The weeks including these holidays are weighted five times higher in the evaluation than non-holiday weeks.
